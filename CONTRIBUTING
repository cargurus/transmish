# Contribution Guide for Transmish

## New features

To request a new feature create a new issue with the `enhancement` label. While _transmish_ appreciates
pull requests, it's advisable to discuss your feature request in an issue
before writing a bunch of code. These discussions will give us a chance to

- Validate that the feature is appropriate for _transmish_ and in line
with the goals of the project
- Discuss how the feature may be implemented, ensuring that the API is consistent with the
design and ethos of `transmish`
- Suggest how to implement the desired behavior using existing functionality when possible
or recommend other libraries that may be more appropriate.

## Bug fixes

Either create an issue with the tag `bug`, or submit a PR with
an explanation of the bug and the proposed fix. Tests for bug fixes are not optional.

## Code of Conduct

This is an open-source library. Any discussion and code is public facing.
Please act like grown-ups and help create an environment of respect and collaboration.
Don't do anything to make me have to add more rules to this section, please.

## Before you submit a PR

- Code should pass the linter. See if yours does by running `yarn lint`.
- Tests should be included in all but the most trivial changes. We don't adhere
to an arbitrary code-coverage percentage, but err on the side of more tests.
- Documentation is always helpful. Components should include a `.stories.tsx` file
when possible. Tests are always the best form of documentation.
- Don't forget to run `yarn build` before submitting your PR.
